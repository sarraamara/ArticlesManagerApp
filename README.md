# ArticlesManagerApp
This is my first project on C#

Users can authentificate and they can get a new password sent to their email address if they forgot it.
Once connected, the user can check the articles( in a DataGridView) that they inserted. They also can modify,insert,delete them and print the list of articles(using Crystal Report). They also can join a chat room where they can chat with other users that are connected to it.


This project uses these technologies:
- C# .NET
- SQL using MS SQL Server
- Sockets(TCP/IP) and Threads for the ChatBox
- SMTP for the mailing system
- Crystal Report
